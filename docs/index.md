    <h2>High-quality, large-scale Web data collection and processing.</h2>
    <p>We have developed a range of infrastructure and cutting-edge technologies to ensure the highest standards of performance, quality and TCO (total cost of ownership), even in very large-scale data collection scenarios.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Network As A Database</h2>
    <p>PulsarR treats the external network as a database. If the required data is not in the local storage, or the existing version does not meet the analysis needs, the system will collect the latest version of the data from the Internet. We also developed X-SQL to query the Web directly and convert webpages into tables and charts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Browser rendering is the primary method to collect Web data</h2>
    <p>By using browser rendering as the primary method to collect Web data, we achieve an optimal balance between data point scale, data quality, labor cost and hardware cost, and achieve the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership). With optimizations such as blocking unnecessary resource files, the performance of browser rendering can even be comparable to the traditional single resource collection method.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>RPA</h2>
    <p>PulsarR includes an RPA subsystem for Web interaction: scrolling, typing, screen capture, dragging and dropping, clicking, etc. This subsystem is similar to the well-known selenium, playwright, puppeteer, but all behaviors are optimized, such as more realistic simulation, better execution performance, better parallelism, better fault tolerance, and so on.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Traditional single resource collection</h2>
    <p>PulsarR’s default data collection method is to harvest the complete Web data through browser rendering, but if the data you need can be retrieved through a single link, for example through an ajax interface, you can also call PulsarR’s resource collection method for high-speed collection.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Cutting-edge information extraction technology</h2>
    <p>We plan to release an advanced AI to automatically extract every field from all valuable webpages (e.g. product detail pages) with remarkable accuracy, and we currently offer a preview version.</p>
